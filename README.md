## ns3 offline-1 | `Simulating Static and Mobile Dumbbell Topology`
- ### Running Static Dumbbell Topology
    - Copy the `wireless-static-dumbbell.cc` file to `scratch` directory of ns3.
    - Copy the `wireless-static-dumbbell.sh` and `gnuplotter.gp` file to ns3 directory (`ns-allinone-[version]/ns-[version]`).
    - Run the `wireless-static-dumbbell.sh` file using the following command from ns3 directory:
        ```
         bash ./wireless-static-dumbbell.sh
        ```
    - A `wireless-static-dumbbell-metrics` folder will be created in ns3 directory. It will contain the metrics and graphs of the simulation.
- ### Running Mobile Dumbbell Topology 
    - Copy the `wireless-mobile-dumbbell.cc` file to `scratch` directory of ns3.
    - Copy the `wireless-mobile-dumbbell.sh` and `gnuplotter.gp` file to ns3 directory (`ns-allinone-[version]/ns-[version]`).
    - Run the `wireless-mobile-dumbbell.sh` file using the following command from ns3 directory:
        ```
         bash ./wireless-mobile-dumbbell.sh
        ```
    - A `wireless-mobile-dumbbell-metrics` folder will be created in ns3 directory. It will contain the metrics and graphs of the simulation.
